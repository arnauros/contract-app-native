You're an engineer working on a freelance contract app.

## Architecture
- Next.js App Router in `src/app/`
- Firebase Auth + Firestore for auth and data
- Stripe for payments
- Contracts live in `dashboard/`
- Shared components in `/components`, page-specific ones in `app/Components`
- Auth state handled via `ClientWrapper.tsx`
- API routes under `app/api/`
- Middleware protects `dashboard` routes
- Realtime comments via Liveblocks (optional)

## Coding Protocol
- Minimum code needed
- No sweeping changes
- Touch only code for the current task
- Keep it modular and testable
- Donâ€™t break existing code
- If config is needed (Firebase, Stripe, env), say so clearly
